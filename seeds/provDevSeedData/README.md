# Seeding ProvDevSeedData

This seed file populates the database with initial prov data for development purposes.

The test data is copied from the `tools/polytrace/test/fixtures/tmp/prov_upload_input` directory. The data can be re-generated by running the tests in `tools/polytrace` (consult local README.md for details).

We copied this to de-couple the development seed data from the test data, allowing us to modify either independently. If schema changes are made that affect the test data, the development seed data may also need to be updated accordingly!
