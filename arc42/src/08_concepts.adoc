== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Provenance Tracking

Automatic capture of code, parameters, environment, and outputs for every run.

=== Minimal Friction

Adapters require minimal changes to existing codebases.

=== Output Agnosticism

Support for various output formats and types.

=== Sensible Defaults

Automatic versioning and environment capture, overridable by user.

=== Governance by Design

Convenience drives adoption; provenance is built-in, not enforced.

=== Security and Privacy

Sensitive data is protected; metadata is stored securely.

=== Pragmatic Layering

Layers are introduced only when complexity demands, keeping the system maintainable and extensible.
