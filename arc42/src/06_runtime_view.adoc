== Runtime View

The repository contains the web application, API, and DB migration tooling. The following runtime scenarios illustrate how provenance-related workflows would behave; note that parts of these scenarios (CLI adapters, provenance server) are design-level examples and are not yet implemented .


=== Simulation Run Scenario

* Researcher runs simulation code via CLI tool which automatically captures metadata 
* Output file hashes are logged and input files are cloned and linked to the run
* CLI tool reports run information to provenance server
* Provenance server organizes and stores the run information

=== Analysis Script Scenario

* Researcher runs analysis script via CLI tool
* CLI tool links modifying script to simulation results and source code
* Server updates provenance chain

=== Provenance Query Scenario

* User queries server for provenance of a result
* Server returns chain of metadata, code version, and environment
