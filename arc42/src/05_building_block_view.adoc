Motivation::
Enable traceable, reproducible research with minimal workflow disruption.

Contained Building Blocks::
- Adapters: Python decorator, C++ header
- CLI tool: links scripts, outputs, and code
- Server: receives, organizes, and serves provenance data
- Database: stores metadata, results, and links
- Search UI: enables provenance queries

Important Interfaces::
- Adapter <-> Server: API for metadata reporting
- CLI Tool <-> Server: API for linking and querying
- Server <-> Database: storage and retrieval
